        Hello my name is Muhammad Gata. I was born in Malang East Java, but i
        spent time living in Mojokerto East Java. I have good skill in Front-end
        Development. Now, i focused how to make beautifull user interface and
        satisfied user exprerience to increase user enjoyment.

      <p class="leading-loose">
        I chose front end development because I love to see beautiful designs,
        smooth interactivity in website and about the right layout. For me,
        pouring design as code is the best healing for now.
